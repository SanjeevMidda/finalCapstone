    Thinking
        This website contains information and photos about some places I have visited in the world.
        1. Basic html boilerplate, so our browser know its dealing with a html document.
        2. Name of our website displayed in the browser tab, and for accesibility and seo purposes. 
        3. Link to our external css styles. Without this we wouldn't be able to style our css.
        4. Our "mainPageContainer" element holds our content and used for layout purposes - added a value of flex to this.
        5. A "Nav" tag used to hold our navigation elements and a "h2" title.
        6. An "ul" created with several items. Used the "a" tag to link to other pages within our website.
        7. A "div" created with an id of "block". This allowed me to create the blue,rectangular shape using css.

        Note: I originally placed the links to the other countries in a folder called "countries", however when opening the page without using live server, the pages wouldn't load. So I have placed all files in the same directory, as Dropbox doesn't allow access to these files otherwise. In a production setting, I of course, would have placed these in their own folder.
